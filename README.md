# CustomRaiseBuckle
Raise Buckles are fidget toy-like items featured in 2022-2023's Kamen Rider Geats. Within the show, Raise Buckles are items that give the Kamen Rider heroes different weapons and armors to help them combat threats and rise through the ranks in the Battle Royale survival game, "Desire Grand Prix". 

In the real world, Raise Buckles are toys sold by Bandai Japan and function with the Deluxe (DX) Desire Driver. Each Raise Buckle has bar of plastic on the back that has different patterns of raised and black notches. These bars have guide rails on the sides that allow the buckle to stay inserted in the Desire Driver's left and right sides. The pattern of notches and blank spots hit 3 different switches on the Desire Drivers that indicate which buckle is being inserted.
